## What is AI Optimal Camouflage?

AI Optimal Camouflage is a cutting-edge concept that leverages advanced video capture and projection technology to create the illusion of invisibility. Using a system of strategically placed cameras and high-resolution displays, objects such as coats, hats, or shoes can blend seamlessly into their surroundings by displaying real-time video of the environment.

This project explores the potential for developing wearable, near-invisible technology for various applications, including fashion, security, and entertainment.

## Features

Real-Time Video Capture: Multiple cameras capture the surrounding environment from various angles.

Dynamic Projection: Flexible, high-resolution displays project real-time video onto the object’s surface.

AI Calibration: AI algorithms adjust the video feed to match the observer’s perspective, ensuring seamless camouflage.

Ambient Adaptation: The system adjusts to lighting conditions and surface textures for enhanced realism.

## How It Works

1. Capture the Environment
Cameras integrated into the wearable capture real-time video of the environment from all angles.


2. Process the Data
AI algorithms process the video feeds to adjust for perspective, lighting, and observer position.


3. Display the Environment
The processed video is displayed on flexible screens embedded into the object, recreating the background.


4. Create the Illusion
The system dynamically updates the display to mimic transparency, creating the illusion of invisibility.
